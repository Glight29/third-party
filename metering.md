# Metering integration
{: #meteringintera}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} supports multiple models for aggregating offering usage. Offering providers measure various metrics on the provisioned instances and submit those measures to the metering service. The rating service aggregates the submitted usage into different buckets (instance, resource group, and account) based on the model that offering providers choose. The aggregation and rating models for all the metrics in a plan are contained in the metering and rating definition documents for the plan.
{:shortdesc}

The following list describes the expectations for tracking and submitting usage:

*	Third-party offering providers do not need to submit usage for free plans.
*	Third-party offering providers do not need to submit usage for monthly subscription plans.
*	For metered plans, all offering providers must submit usage hourly (Lite plans must submit every 15 minutes to 1 hour).
*	The offering provider is responsible for automating usage submission, including automation that attempts failure responses again. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} does not provide a retry function for failed submissions. See the status codes and actions table in [Submitting usage records](/docs/third-party/submitusage.html#submitting-usage-records) for more information.
*	Usage records for the current month have to be submitted, at the latest, by the 2nd of the following month.
*	{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is configured for a monthly billing cycle and time is represented in UTC.
*  Offering providers must test usage submission and validate their results to inform how the monthly billing cycle is calculated.

See [How to calculate your costs](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/billing-usage/estimating_costs.html#cost) for general information about pricing.

## Configuration properties
{: #configure}

The following properties define how usage submissions for offering plans are metered and rated:

<dl>
<dt>Unit</dt>
<dd>Metrics to be metered, for example, ApiCall, Bytes, Hours, Instances, and Nodes.</dd>
<dt>Aggregation</dt>
<dd>How metered unit data is compiled, for example INSTANCES_BY_MONTH, or ACTIVE_HOURS_BY_MONTH.</dd>
<dt>Metering model</dt>
<dd>How usage submission data is processed, as shown in the following table.</dd>

### Examples
Note that the quantity in the dashboard in each of the following examples is before the next usage is submitted but after the current usage is processed.

#### Standard Add
Calculate the usages for the entire month.

Formula: ADD(usages)

| Time            | Usage Sent In | Calculation | Quantity in Dashboard |
|-----------------|:-------------:| ----------- |:---------------------:|
| Day 1 (morning) | 5             | 5           | 5                     |
| Day 1 (night)   | 5             | 5 + 5       | 10                    |
| Day 2 (morning) | 5             | 10 + 5      | 15                    |
| Day 3 (morning) | 5             | 15 + 5      | 20                    |
| Day 4 (night)   | 5             | 20 + 5      | 25                    |

#### Standard Average
Calculate the average of the usages for the entire month. Note that submitting a zero usage also counts toward the average.

Formula: AVG(usages)

| Time            | Usage Sent In | Calculation             | Quantity in Dashboard |
|-----------------|:-------------:| ----------------------- |:---------------------:|
| Day 1 (morning) | 4             | 4 / 1                   | 4                     |
| Day 1 (night)   | 0             | (4 + 0) / 2             | 2                     |
| Day 2 (morning) | 5             | (4 + 0 + 5) / 3         | 3                     |
| Day 3 (morning) | 3             | (4 + 0 + 5 + 3) / 4     | 3                     |
| Day 4 (night)   | 3             | (4 + 0 + 5 + 3 + 3) / 5 | 3                     |

#### Standard Max
Calculate the maximum of the usages for the entire month.

Formula: MAX(usages)

| Time            | Usage Sent In  | Calculation  | Quantity in Dashboard |
|-----------------|:--------------:| ------------ |:---------------------:|
| Day 1 (morning) | 5              | MAX(5)       | 5                     |
| Day 1 (night)   | 10             | MAX(5, 10)   | 10                    |
| Day 2 (morning) | 0              | MAX(10, 0)   | 10                    |
| Day 3 (morning) | 15             | MAX(10, 15)  | 15                    |
| Day 4 (night)   | 1              | MAX(15, 1)   | 15                    |

#### Dailyproration Average
Calculate the average usage for each day and average it for the month. The average of each day is added up and divided by the number of days currently passed (in UTC).

Formula: Summation(daily average) / Number of days passed in billing period

Note that the quantity might change throughout the month, but what is rated is the average usage per day.

Given a 30-day month:

| Time               | Usage Sent In    | Daily Average | Calculation                            | Quantity in Dashboard*                           |
| ------------------ | :--------------: | ------------- | ------------------                     | :----------------------------------------------: |
| Day 1 (morning)    | 8                | 8 / 1         | 8 / 1                                  | 8                                                |
| Day 1 (night)      | 3                | (8 + 3) / 2   | 5.5 / 1                                | 5.5 (On Day 1 EOD)                               |
| Day 2 (morning)    | 2                | 2 / 1         | (5.5 + 2) / 2                          | 3.75                                             |
| Day 2 (night)      | 5                | (2 + 5) / 2   | (5.5 + 3.5) / 2                        | 4.5 (On Day 2 EOD)                               |
| Day 3 to Day 15    | 1                | 1 / 1         | (5.5 + 3.5 + (1 + 13)  / 15            | 1.4666  (On Day 15 EOD)                          |
| Day 15 to Day 30   | 0                | 0 / 1         | (5.5 + 3.5 + (1 * 12) + (0  * 15) / 30 | 0.7333  (On Day 20 EOD)                          |

\* As seen on the same day as when the usage was submitted.

#### Dailyproration Max
Calculate the maximum usage per day and average it for the month. The maximum of each day is added up and divided by the number of days currently passed (in UTC).

Formula: Summation(daily max) / number of days passed in billing period

Note that the quantity might change throughout the month, but what is rated is the maximum usage per day.

Given a 30-day month:

| Time             | Usage Sent In  | Daily Max | Calculation                    | Quantity in Dashboard* |
|------------------|:--------------:| --------- | ------------------------------ |:----------------------:|
| Day 1 (morning)  | 0              | MAX(0)    | 0 / 1                          | 0                      |
| Day 1 (night)    | 1              | MAX(0, 1) | 1 / 1                          | 1                      |
| Day 2 to Day 15  | 1              | MAX(1)    | (1 + 1 + ...) / day            | 1                      |
| Day 15 to Day 30 | 0              | MAX(0)    | (1 + (1 * 14) + 0 + ...) / day | < 1                    |

\* As seen on the same day as when the usage was submitted.

## Metering and rating scale examples
{: #scale-examples}

You can use the scaling configuration to compile the unit quantity differently from what is sent in usage submissions to what is displayed in the Usage Dashboard, and what is finally used for the rating and cost calculations. The following examples demonstrate scenarios when these values should be configured:

### You want more granularity than what users see
You want to send usages at a more granular level, but you want to show customers a more readable number.

For example, you might want to measure an instance's traffic in bytes and want the aggregated values in megabytes. To do this, you add a `scale` of 1024 to the **metering** configuration.

### You want more granularity than what your pricing configuration has
You price your metrics as $X / gigabyte, but you want to send them in megabytes. If your metric is priced at $1 / gigabyte, but a user uses 0.5 megabytes, they are charged $1 since your pricing is per gigabyte. You add a `scale` of 1024 to the **rating** configuration and set `clip` to `true`.

This holds true if your metric is also priced as $X per 100 API calls (or some other pack size).

### You want to scale at both metering and rating levels
You can add scaling to both metering and rating configurations. If you want to send in bytes but show megabytes to the user, you configure the metering scale to 1024. If your metric price is in gigabytes, you also configure the rating scale to be 1024.

## Pricing models
{: #pricing}

The following table provides detailed information about the pricing models that are available. For many of the available metrics, you select an associated pricing model.

| Model          | Description | Calculation | Example (5000 quantity) |
|:-----------------|:-------------|:----------- |:---------------------|
| Linear         | Multiply the unit price per resource (P) by the usage quantity (Q) to get the total amount (T)  | P*Q    | P=$1 T=1*5000 =$5000        |
| Proration      | Multiply the daily unit price per resource (P) by the daily usage quantity (Q) to get the total daily amount. The total charge involves cumulating the charges for all days within the given month.         | T= (pd * Q1) + ...+(Pd *Qn)     | <ul><li>P= $30</li><li>Pd (daily price) =$30/30=$1 (assuming 30 days in a month)</li><li>T1= $1 * 1 =$1</li><li>T2 = $1 * 0 =$0</li><li>Tn = 1 * 1 =$1</li><li>T = $1 + $0 +...+$1 = $5000</li></ul>     |
| Simple tier (granular tier)  | A P*Q model in which the unit price for all consumption is determined by the tier the quanitity falls into.           | <ul><li>If Q is <=Q1, T=P1*Q</li><li>If Q1 < Q <=Q2, T=P2*Q</li><li>If Q2 < Q <=Q3, T=P3*Q</li></ul>     |   <ul><li>Q1=1000, P1=$1</li><li>Q2=2500, P2=$0.9</li><li>Q3=10000, P3=$0.75</li><li>T=$0.75*5000=$3750</li></ul>              |
| Graduated tier (step tier)   | The price per unit varies as the quantity consumed moves into different predefined tiers. The total charge involves cumulating the charges from the previous tiers           | <ul><li>T1=P1*Q (0 < Q</li><li>If Q1 < Q <=Q2, T=T2</li><li>If Q2 < Q <=Q3, T=T3</li></ul>     | <ul><li>Q1=1000, P1=$1, T1=1*1000</li><li>Q2=1500, P2=$0.9, T2=0.9*1500</li><li>Q3=10000, P3=$0.75, T3=0.75*2500</li><li>T=1000 +1350+1875=$4225</li></ul>          |
| Block tier (up to)           | The total amount charged is established by an "up to" quantity that does not vary within the block     | <ul><li>If Q is <=Q1, T=T1</li><li>If Q1 < Q <=Q2, T=T2</li><li>If Q2 < Q <=Q3, T=T3</li></ul>    |  <ul><li>Q1=1000, T1=$0</li><li>Q2=2500, T2=2500</li><li>Q3=10000, T3=$4500</li><li>T=$4500</li></ul>            |
